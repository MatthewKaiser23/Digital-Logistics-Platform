# BDE Project: Digital Logistics Platform

## Introduction

This is a Big Data Engineering project focused on the development of a digital logistics platform. This platform is designed to manage the global delivery of South African wine to four-starred restaurants worldwide. It uses big data technologies and analytical tools to optimize the wine delivery process, utilizing real-time data sources to ensure efficient deliveries.

## Project Overview

The Big Data Engineering course covers various aspects of big data processes, platforms, and ecosystems. In this project, the key components include:

- Parallel Processing
- Process Management
- File System Management
- Data Analytics
- APIs
- Big Data Ecosystems - "Hadoop" and "Spark"

## Objectives

1. Develop a digital logistics platform for managing wine deliveries to four-starred restaurants.
2. Utilize big data technologies, including Hadoop and Spark, to design and develop the platform.
3. Enable path optimization for deliveries using live data sources such as flight schedules, weather conditions, and routes.
4. Ensure wine deliveries meet the restaurants' operational hours.

## Implementation Details

### Wine Delivery

Four-star restaurants receive wine from a Cape Town Wine Farm in South Africa. The path planning process uses APIs to receive live data.

### Real-Time Data Integration

The platform uses real-time data sources to optimize delivery routes. Key features include:

- Delivery starts after the flight from Cape Town.
- A fleet of trucks are available, each capable of delivering up to several locations.
- Path optimization.

## Conclusion

This platform enhances operational efficiency, meets the restaurants' preferences for deliveries, and contributes to cost-effective route planning.
